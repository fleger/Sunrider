* added icons for armor and shield negation, plus attacking with missiles now show the route the missiles will take on the map along with an indicator for combined intercept change between the attacker and the target. [by KingRaptor]
* the accuracy of energy weapons (laser+pulse) now degrade at a rate of 10 per hex instead of 15. to compensate, their base accuracy is reduced by 10. as a result, accuracy upgrades are now very valuable and costs for these have increased.

* added an item that reduces energy cost of the gravity gun from 60 to 40. available after mission 12 (far port)
* the furthest to the right you can now place units during formation phase is column 6 (down from 7). 1 exception is the 2nd escort mission (mission 18)
* The AI now considers attacking with melee a bit better.
* the repair upgrade for the Liberty now also reduces repair energy cost by 10EN. to compensate, the upgrade had its price increased to 1000$
* the Phoenix' max EN upgrades are now 25% cheaper, allowing for greater mobility and damage output.

* accuracy buffs no longer affect healing and other support skills.
* the range on the gravity gun is now infinite.

patch 3.1a~c
========
minor bugfixes

patch 3.1
========
* fixed not being able to load after a game over.
* fixed the game crashing after loading an old save file where the phoenix hadn't been created.
* fixed old missiles showing up when you fire your own.
* fixed non-player factions shooting each other's missiles
* fixed rockets taking their EN cost twice
* fixed shielding not getting calculated properly
* fixed being able to roll back by scrolling up in the wrong place in the upgrade screen.
* fixed 'end turn' button remaining on screen (and active) during enemy turn



* improved various scene transitions
* improved unit movement animation
* rockets are now less likely to get shot down by flak compared to regular missiles. warning: this means enemy rockets are more dangerous too!
* blackjacks missiles are nerfed. from 10 misiles per salvo to 6 missiles. this cuts her max damage by 40%. the Sunrider should logically be able to fire a lot more missiles than a Ryder could.
* missile accuracy upgrade has been replaced by flak resistance upgrade. every point in this new stat reduces enemy flak% by 1. this change is visually reflected in the targeting window when hovering over a missile or rocket weapon.
* added a button on the R&D screen that will remove all upgrades and refunds (most) of the money you spent on them. this will also update new balance changes. this feature is not guaranteed to be in the final game and mostly is there for debug/testing purposes.
* added a button that will undo your previous movement. this button is only available right after making a momevement and only when you did not trigger a counter attack. known issue: hovering over a weapon button wil also make the button disappear.




beta 3
=======

changed:
* enemy phoenix is now immune to counter attacks
* changed EN upgrades to go in units of 5 (thanks ledabot)
* fixed not being able to use a weapon because game didn't check for cost upgrades when deciding when a button is clickable

* added a cover mechanic. Asteroids can be spawned in a battle that will have a chance of blocking attacks aimed at a unit on the same cell; until the asteroid is destroyed.
* rewrote buff code to make it neater and more flexible
* stealth is now fully auto self-cast. adding more skills like this will be easy.
* rewrote weapon button display code to be neater. this technique will be useful rewriting ship display code.
* rewrote selection code so it's neater and more rugged. been wanting to do that for a long time
* pretty massive rewrite of ship display code. much much less messy now. I don't think I managed to make it more efficient though, regretably.
* added a new secret weapon
* added HP value on enemy HP bar. removed EN bar
* added basic debuff functionality

* added icons and stat details to show the actual effect of upgrades
